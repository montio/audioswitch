IMPORTANT, WARNING, YOU COULD DIE!
This is a quick and dirty hack. There is NO WARRANTY for anything. Well, expect one thing:
You have to modify the code, otherwise it won't work :)

You have to modify the code to make it working with your hardware.
You find all places in the code by searching for "IMPORTANT"

If you use PULSEAUDIO:
    First, you have to specify that you want to use PULSEAUDIO by setting in the constructor the api-variable as follwed:
    self.api = API.PULSEAUDIO

    Next you have to configure the sink-ports. All information about the sinkname and its port can be listed by the following command:
    $ pacmd list-sinks
    modify the pacmd-calles in the SwitchToSpeaker function and the SwitchToHeadphone function

If you use ALSA:
    First, you have to specify that you want to use ALSA by setting in the constructor the api-variable as follwed:
    self.api = API.ALSA

    Next you have configure the mixer-names for your speaker and your headphone.
    You can find out the names by running the alsamixer and check the behavior of the sliders :)
    modify the alsaaudio.Mixer-arguments in the SwitchToSpeaker function and the SwitchToHeadphone function

good luck :)


To install, put all files into a zip-archive …

… and use plasmapkg to install ist. With -r you can remove it.
